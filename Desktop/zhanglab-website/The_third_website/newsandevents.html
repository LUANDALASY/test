                Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and greater knowledge of the metastatic microen- vironment is necessary to effectively target this process. Microenvironmental changes occur at distant sites prior to clinically detectable metastatic disease; however, the key niche regulatory signals during metastatic progression remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a core immune suppression gene signature in pre- metastatic niche formation that is expressed predominantly by myeloid cells. We target this immune sup- pression program by utilizing genetically engineered myeloid cells (GEMys) to deliver IL-12 to modulate the metastatic microenvironment. Our data demonstrate that IL12-GEMy treatment reverses immune sup- pression in the pre-metastatic niche by activating antigen presentation and T cell activation, resulting in reduced metastatic and primary tumor burden and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. We demon- strate that IL12-GEMys can functionally modulate the core program of immune suppression in the pre-met- astatic niche to successfully rebalance the dysregulated metastatic microenvironment in cancer.

                KRAS-mutant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly immunosuppressive and resistant to targeted and immuno- therapies. Among the different PDAC subtypes, basal-like mesenchymal PDAC, which is driven by allelic imbalance, increased gene dosage and subsequent high expression levels of oncogenic KRAS, shows the most aggressive phenotype and strongest therapy resistance. In the present study, we performed a systematic high-throughput combination drug screen and identi- fied a synergistic interaction between the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the multi-kinase inhibitor nintedanib, which targets KRAS-directed oncogenic signaling in mesenchymal PDAC. This combination treatment induces cell-cycle arrest and cell death, and initiates a context-dependent remodeling of the immunosuppressive cancer cell secretome. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-sequencing, CRISPR screens and immunophenotyping, we show that this combination therapy promotes intra- tumor infiltration of cytotoxic and effector T cells, which sensitizes mesenchymal PDAC to PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition. Overall, our results open new avenues to target this aggressive and therapy-refractory mesenchymal PDAC subtype.

                Endometrial disorders represent a major gynaecological burden. Current research models fail to recapitulate the nature and heterogeneity of these diseases, thereby hampering scientific and clinical progress. Here we developed long-term expandable organoids from a broad spectrum of endometrial pathologies. Organoids from endometriosis show disease-associated traits and cancer-linked mutations. Endometrial cancer-derived organoids accurately capture cancer subtypes, replicate the mutational landscape of the tumours and display patient-specific drug responses. Organoids were also established from precancerous pathologies encompassing endometrial hyperplasia and Lynch syndrome, and inherited gene mutations were maintained. Endometrial disease organoids reproduced the original lesion when transplanted in vivo. In summary, we developed multiple organoid models that capture endometrial disease diversity and will provide powerful research models and drug screening and discovery tools.

                Copy number alterations (CNAs), elicited by genome instability, are a major source of intratumor heterogeneity. How CNAs evolve in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown.We performed single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) on 1275 cells isolated from 10 patients with HCC, ploidy-resolved scDNA-seq on 356 cells from 1 additional patient, and single-cell RNA sequencing on 27,344 cells from 3 additional patients. Three statistical fitting models were compared to investigate the CNA accumulation pattern.

                Drug discovery focused on target proteins has been a successful strategy, but many diseases and biological processes lack obvious targets to enable such approaches. Here, to overcome this challenge, we describe a deep learning–based efficacy prediction
system (DLEPS) that identifies drug candidates using a change in the gene expression profile in the diseased state as input.
DLEPS was trained using chemically induced changes in transcriptional profiles from the L1000 project. We found that the
changes in transcriptional profiles for previously unexamined molecules were predicted with a Pearson correlation coefficient
of 0.74. We examined three disorders and experimentally tested the top drug candidates in mouse disease models. Validation
showed that perillen, chikusetsusaponin IV and trametinib confer disease-relevant impacts against obesity, hyperuricemia and
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, respectively. DLEPS can generate insights into pathogenic mechanisms, and we demonstrate that
the MEK–ERK signaling pathway is a target for developing agents against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Our findings suggest
that DLEPS is an effective tool for drug repurposing and discovery.

                Interacting with proteins is a crucial way for long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to exert their
biological responses. Here we report a high throughput strategy to characterize lncRNA
interacting proteins in vivo by combining tobramycin affinity purification and mass spectrometric analysis (TOBAP-MS). Using this method, we identify 140 candidate binding
proteins for lncRNA highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC). Intriguingly, HULC directly
binds to two glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and pyruvate kinase M2
(PKM2). Mechanistic study suggests that HULC functions as an adaptor molecule that
enhances the binding of LDHA and PKM2 to fibroblast growth factor receptor type 1 (FGFR1),
leading to elevated phosphorylation of these two enzymes and consequently promoting
glycolysis. This study provides a convenient method to study lncRNA interactome in vivo and
reveals a unique mechanism by which HULC promotes Warburg effect by orchestrating the
enzymatic activities of glycolytic enzymes.

                We performed genomic and transcriptomic sequencing of 133 combined hepatocellular and
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-ICC) cases, including separate, combined, and mixed
subtypes. Integrative comparison of cHCC-ICC with hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic
cholangiocarcinoma revealed that combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs are distinct subtypes
with different clinical and molecular features. Integrating laser microdissection, cancer cell
fraction analysis, and single nucleus sequencing, we revealed both mono- and multiclonal origins
in the separate type cHCC-ICCs, whereas combined and mixed type cHCC-ICCs were all
monoclonal origin. Notably, cHCC-ICCs showed significantly higher expression of Nestin,
suggesting Nestin may serve as a biomarker for diagnosing cHCC-ICC. Our results provide
important biological and clinical insights into cHCC-ICC.
